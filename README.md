# nesting-art
this project is dedicated to my grandma. she showed me her sketchbook, and it was filled with similar drawings -- where one shape was repeatedly rotated and inscribed, and this pattern was repeated across the canvas to create an abstract piece. as i was leaving the room, she told me that I should try my hand at her art style. using some basic trig and polar math, I came up with this. I'll show it to her tomorrow :)
